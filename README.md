Root cause reasoning helps in business by identifying the underlying cause of a problem, rather than just addressing its symptoms. This approach allows for more effective problem-solving and decision-making, as it helps to prevent the same issues from recurring in the future. By understanding the root cause of a problem, businesses can also make more informed decisions about resource allocation and process improvement.
